# Target-Tracking-using-Kalman-Filter
This Repository contains the MATLAB code.

Real time object was tracked which can be input from a video source stored in the computer system or from a USB Camera using MATLAB. At first the video was enhanced frame wise using filtering and thresholding. Then Centroid tracking was done and then using prediction Algorithm implemented with the help of KALMAN filter the Centroid of the object was predicted and the error from phase correlation output in the two consecutive frames was used for Template updating. A GUI was designed in MATLAB for the same. At last using Real time Workshop in MATLAB optimized C++ code was generated.
